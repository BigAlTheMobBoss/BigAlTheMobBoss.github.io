	<p> 	Hello! My name is Alexander Moreno and I am a rising Sophomore at <a href="https://www.bju.edu/"> Bob Jones University.</a>
		I live in Greer, South Carolina and am the oldest of my three other siblings. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, 
		and then moved to Greer SC. I went to Bob Jones Academy from K5 all the way through high school. I 
		graduated 2nd in my class, and that is a fact that I am proud of. At BJU, I am a double major in both 
		Voice Performance and Communication Disorders. I hope to one day either teach voice at the college level or perform.
		I have many hobbies. These include singing, playing chess, running, kayaking, baseball, and spending time with 
		friends and family. </p>
	<p> 	I mentioned chess as one of my interests. I developed a fascination for this game when I was in the sixth grade,
		and I have been playing ever since. I have competed in several tournaments, and I have even gotten to represent
		the entire state of South Carolina in the Denker Tournament of High School Champions. I really enjoy reading
		and learning about the subject, and playing over games of the great masters of the past is one of my favorite things
		to do. I have not gotten the chance to play as much since I have entered college, but I have had time to play 
		a game or two every now and then. Now I work for a company called Think-Move Chess, which is an organization
		devoted to spreading interest of chess amongst kids. <a href="https://www.thinkmovechess.com/"> You can 
		find their website here.</a> </p>
	<p> 	I also really enjoy singing. I used to play the harp, and I even went to "harp camp" at BJU when I was in
		middle-school, but I was never very good at it. Something about looking at a page and then playing a note
		was difficult for me to comprehend. But eveything changed one day when my harp teacher said something profound:
		"Singers have it so easy, all they have to do is think of the note, and there it is!". I thought to myself,
		"Hey, she's right!" and after camp was over, I asked my mother if I could take singing lessons. Confused, she 
		consented, and I have never looked back since. I firmly believe that everyone should learn how to sing
		well, as it is a very joyous experience that helps you one get out of their comfort zone.</p>
